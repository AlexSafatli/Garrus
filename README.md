# Garrus

A very small footprint **Discord bot** written in Golang. This bot can be
deployed
to multiple servers through a single Bot user. All commands are slash commands.

## Implemented Features

- **Dice rolling** of traditionally accepted RPG dice strings.

## History

This project was originally started from scratch with many ideas borrowed from
[NootBot](http://github.com/AlexSafatli/NootBot) - it served as a **soundboard**
for users in a voice channel and
also played sound entrances. This function was since removed as the feature had
been fulfilled and implemented into Discord. Code that fulfilled this purpose is
found in the `v1` branch of this repository.
